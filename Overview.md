The prototype contains only testing data for 1 action. Right now we have received the actual data with a lot more action types.

What we want to do is to include the new data into the app, and possibly the UI refinement.

Overall, the tasks will be:

- Edit the video for model training

- Training the model using Create ML

- Include the new model into the app

- Make instruction UI for each actions

- UI refinement
